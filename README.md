# ðŸŽ¥ Movie_analysis using decision tree
* This repository consists of a model which analyzes the 'collection' acquired (amount raised) by a movie based on various features using the 'regression' method.
* Further, the model predicts whether the movie could win a 'start-tech-oscar' using 'classification' method. 
* 1. Normal decision tree was initially implemented and the accuracy acquired was 54.9%.
* 2. Then pruning, bagging, random forest, grid search, gradient boost, ada boost and XG boost were implemented to increase the accuracy of the model. 
* 3. Support Vector Machines(SVM) were then performed on the model.  
* Inference :
- Collection raised by a movie was best predicted by the regression tree model with an r square value of 0.69.
- Predicting whether a movie could win start-tech-oscar was best fitted by XG Boost with an accuracy of 66.6%.

# Movie_analysis
* This repository consists of a model which analyzes the 'collection' acquired (amount raised) by a movie based on various features using the 'regression' method.
* Further, the model predicts whether the movie could win a 'start-tech-oscar' using 'classification' method. 
* 1. Decision tree was initially implemented and then bagging, random forest, grid search, gradient boost, and ada boost were implemented to increase the accuracy of the model. 
* 2. Support Vector Machines(SVM) were then performed on the model.
